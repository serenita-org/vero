# Setting up the remote signer

For security reasons, Vero never interacts directly with
validator keys. Instead, key management is handled by a
remote signer, such as [Web3Signer](https://docs.web3signer.consensys.io/){:target="_blank"}:

RS(Remote Signer) <--> V(Vero)

```

This improves security, but it makes the initial setup
a little more complicated.

For this quick-start guide, we'll be making
our life easier and use [eth-docker](https://ethdocker.com/){:target="_blank"}
to set up both the remote signer and Vero.
Perform the following steps on the machine you intend to run
Vero on:

1. Clone eth-docker into a new "vero" directory

    ```bash

    cd ~

    git clone https://github.com/ethstaker/eth-docker.git vero

    cd vero
    ```

2. Create a copy of the default config file

    ```bash
    cp default.env .env
    ```

3. Edit the config file

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

    then edit the following lines as needed:

    ```
    COMPOSE_FILE=vero-vc-only.yml:web3signer.yml
    FEE_RECIPIENT=0xYourEthereumAddress # Replace with your own fee recipient
    NETWORK=the network to use, hoodi or mainnet
    WEB3SIGNER=true
    CL_NODE=http://beacon-node:5052
    ```

    Adjust the `CL_NODE` URL as needed â€“ replace `beacon-node:5052` with
    the IP address or hostname and API port of the CL client you set up
    earlier.

!!! tip "Let's check everything is set up correctly"

We still haven't imported our validator keys. However, we can check
if everything is set up correctly so far.

Run `./ethd up` to start Vero and the remote signer.
Then, run `/ethd logs validator` to view Vero's logs.

If you've set everything up correctly, you should see lines
like these in the logs:

```
WARNING: No active or pending validators detected
```
