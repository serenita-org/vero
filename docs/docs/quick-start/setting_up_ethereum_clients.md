# Setting up an Ethereum client pair

There are many ways to deploy the Ethereum
CL/EL client pair that Vero requires to
perform validator duties.

Some of the well-known options include:

- [Dappnode](https://dappnode.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [eth-docker](https://ethdocker.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [EthPillar](https://docs.coincashew.com/ethpillar){:target="_blank"}
- [Eth Wizard](https://github.com/stake-house/eth-wizard){:target="_blank"}
- [Sedge](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/){:target="_blank"}

You can use any of the above options to set up your
Ethereum CL and EL client pair(s).

!!! warning

    Do not load your validator keys anywhere at this stage.
    While setting up your Ethereum clients, you should only
    run the CL and EL clients â€“ without performing validator duties.
